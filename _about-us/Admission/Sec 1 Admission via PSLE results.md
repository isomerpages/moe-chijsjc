You may click [here](https://www.moe.gov.sg/microsites/psle-fsbb/posting-to-secondary-school/main.html) to find out more about how to choose and apply to a suitable secondary school under the new PSLE scoring and Sec 1 posting systems. 

**Affiliated students from CHIJ OLGC & CHIJ OLN (Primary Schools)**

The following primary schools are affiliated to CHIJ St. Joseph’s Convent:

  

*   CHIJ Our Lady of Good Counsel (CHIJ OLGC)
*   CHIJ Our Lady of Nativity (CHIJ OLN)

  

If a child is studying in CHIJ OLGC or CHIJ OLN and wants to continue her secondary education in the affiliated secondary school, CHIJ St, Joseph’s Convent, she must indicate CHIJ SJC as the first choice school, in order to enjoy priority for admission to the affiliated secondary school. 

NOTE: Being accorded priority for admission does not guarantee admission to CHIJ St. Joseph’s Convent, as it is subject to availability of places. Depending on the demand and choice patterns of that year, if there is more demand from eligible affiliates than the available places at Sec 1 posting, posting-in of affiliates will be based on their PSLE scores. This may result in some affiliates not being admitted despite meeting the Affiliate Minimum Requirement.
