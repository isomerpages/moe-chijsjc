| CHIJ St. Joseph's Convent (SJC) began as a private school in a rented house at Flower Road. There were 21 pupils under the care of one nun of the Order of the Holy Infant Jesus and two teachers. The school was then known as Paya Lebar Convent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| After the war, the school reopened in a bungalow lent by a neighbor, off Upper Serangoon Road where the present “The Helping Hand’, a Christian halfway house stands. Enrolment then had risen to 214. The school then moved to 11 Hillside Drive where a wooden building comprising four classrooms was erected, all paid for by mission funds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| A year after the war ended, Paya Lebar Convent was renamed St. Joseph’s Convent – in recognition of the protection the Saint had given our school through Sister Theodora’s prayers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
