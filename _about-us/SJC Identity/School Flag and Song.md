#### **Our School Song**

*Saint Joseph’s, Saint Joseph’s, we pledge our loyalty to Thee.*

*With you, we spend our golden days, happy and free.*

*Simple in our virtue, Steadfast in our work.*

*Together we strive to live up to your worth.*

*In one resounding voice we sing to your praise.*

*Long live Saint Joseph’s, with the help of God's grace.*
