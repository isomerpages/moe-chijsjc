CHIJ St. Joseph's Convent (SJC) began as a private school in a rented house at Flower Road in 1938. There were 21 pupils under the care of one nun of the Order of the Holy Infant Jesus and two teachers. The school was then known as Paya Lebar Convent.

The enrolment rose steadily to 79 pupils with classes from Primary 1 to Secondary 3 up till the outbreak of World War II in 1945.
After the war, the school reopened in a bungalow lent by a neighbor, off Upper Serangoon Road where the present “The Helping Hand’, a Christian halfway house stands. Enrolment then had risen to 214.

In 1945, SJC moved to 11 Hillside Drive where a wooden building comprising four classrooms was erected, all paid for by mission funds. A year later, Paya Lebar Convent was renamed **St. Joseph’s Convent** – in recognition of the protection the Saint had given our school through Sister Theodora’s prayers.

In 1949, SJC was approved as an Aided School. In the following years, enrollment swelled and the school expanded with the addition of new classrooms along Highland Road, and the installation of a science laboratory and kitchen.

Netball as a co-curricular activity was started in 1965 by teacher Mrs Cecile Tan who served as both coach and teacher-in-charge. The sport became a niche CCA for generations of students who were known to be formidable opponents in Netball at the National School Games and the Pesta Sukan competitions.

After Singapore's independence, the school's primary section was gradually phased out. In 1974, SJC became a full-fledged secondary school with morning and afternoon sessions. CHIJ Our Lady of the Nativity (OLN) and CHIJ Our Lady of Good Counsel (OLGC) became the primary schools affiliated to SJC.
