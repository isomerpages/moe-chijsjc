<p>In Aesthetics, we seek to develop our students to be independent and creative
learners who possess an awareness and appreciation of art and music in
varied forms.</p>
<h3><strong>ART</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Our Objectives:</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To provide meaningful and authentic art learning experiences that nurture
students’ creativity and appreciation for the visual arts.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>

making.</p>
</li>

<h4><strong>Our Approach:</strong></h4>
<p>In SJC, students learn art through an investigative, student-centred inquiry-based
learning approach that focuses on their research, idea development, analysis
of artworks, and artmaking processes.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Our Programme:</strong></h4>
<p>In the Lower Secondary Art curriculum, students learn to&nbsp;<strong>Perceive</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Communicate</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Appreciate</strong>&nbsp;through
learning the:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Context of Art making</strong>&nbsp;– conditions that lead to
the ideas of the work and why works are created in certain ways</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Artistic Processes</strong>&nbsp;– methods that artists use to
gather and develop ideas for their works</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Media</strong>&nbsp;– how to use materials, tools and techniques</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Visual Qualities</strong>&nbsp;– how to use elements of Art and
principles of design to create desired effects</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the Upper Secondary Art curriculum, students develop their technical
and explorative skills through exposure to various 2D and 3D art media.
The students deepen and develop their appreciation of, interest and critical
thinking in art through the affordances of ICT, experiential learning journeys
to art institutions and organisations, as well as Art enrichment workshops.</p>
<p>Students at all levels also benefit from the <strong>Artist in School Scheme (AISS</strong>),
where professional artists conduct talks and master classes for students
to engage them further in different genres of art. To encourage our budding
artists, students’ works-in-progress are also celebrated monthly. The “Artists
of the Month” affirms students’ creativity and highlights our emphasis
on the process of art learning rather than the finished product.</p>

<h3><strong>MUSIC</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Our Objectives:</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

students’ musicianship and appreciation for music.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To develop creative expressions through individual and collaborative music

</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Our Approach:</strong></h4>
<p>Using the E-C-A Approach, our students learn music through:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Experiential</strong>&nbsp;music-making activities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exposure to musical&nbsp;<strong>Concepts</strong>

<p><em>MOE Primary and Lower Secondary Music Framework</em>
</p>
<h4><strong>Our Programme:</strong></h4>
<p>The lower secondary music curriculum explores an array of genres of music
through&nbsp; <strong>Listening</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Performing</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Creating</strong>.</p>
<p>The music lessons are designed to provide students a platform for music
exploration and creative music making in the following programmes:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Instrumental skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Composing and arranging using Music Technology</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opportunities to attend music events to develop music appreciation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensemble music making</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Performance opportunities to demonstrate understanding of musical concepts
/ skills</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Students with the passion for music are given the chance to perform both
in and out of school. A highlight this year was the Singapore Youth Station,
where young musicians compose and produce original works under mentorship,
culminating in a showcase of their creativity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are proud to share that three SJCians received recognition awards for
their original compositions. Their dedication and talent have brought pride
to SJC and exemplify our vibrant school arts culture.</p>
