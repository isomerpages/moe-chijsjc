##### **Our Objectives**


Students will  

*   acquire skills in using a variety of computer application software and hardware to accomplish tasks and communicate ideas;

*   recognise the impact of ICT on society and people; and
*   develop basic computational thinking and problem-solving skills.

##### **Our Approach**

* Key pedagogical approach includes
    - students learning through doing where they design and create computational artefacts, generate solutions to tasks/ problems and examine computer programmes
    - students learning through solving authentic problems by using the Stop-Think-Act-Review approach

*   Building responsibility in our students using the Responsibility Instructional Approach to develop our students as self-directed and collaborative learners.
