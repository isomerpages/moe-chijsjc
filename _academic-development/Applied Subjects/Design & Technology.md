<h4><strong>Our Objectives</strong></h4>
<p>D&amp;T prepares students for living and working in an ever-changing world
by helping them recognise the need for new or modified products/systems.
It gives students the capacity and confidence to design, make and evaluate
the products/systems independently.</p>
<p>The objectives of the D&amp;T curriculum are as follow:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To engage the creative and inquisitive instinct of students by using design
in problem-solving,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To develop basic design thinking and communication skills,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To allow students to realise their design through prototype making and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To develop autonomous decision-makers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Our Approach</strong></h4>
<p>The students embark on their design journey through projects during the
two- year course. Students advance their knowledge and skills by working
side by side with their teachers who facilitate the process of designing
solutions to a challenge or problem.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Achievement</strong></h4>
<p>In SJC, Lower Secondary students learn Design and Technology over the
course of one semester in each year. They embark on the following projects
over two years:</p>

<h4><strong>Our Achievement</strong></h4>
<p>Interested Secondary 2 students are selected to take part in design and
engineering competitions, giving them an opportunity to explore and apply
their learning.</p>
<p>In 2023, a team of Secondary 2 students clinched the 1st Prize in the
Automata Category in the Toy Design Competition organised by the Mechanical
and Aeronautical Engineering Department of the Singapore Polytechnic with
their unique ideas on Urban Farming!</p>
