<h4><strong>Our Objectives</strong></h4>
<p>In light of changing lifestyles, technological advancements and innovations
in food products, Nutrition and Food Science aims to develop our students
to be:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Food Ambassadors by advocating nutrition and health for self, family and
the community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discerning Consumers by appreciating how a variety of food is used in
food management and taking into consideration issues of food security.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Food Innovators by applying scientific principles during food preparation
and cooking.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>Our Approach</strong></h4>
<p>We encourage our students to be self-directed learners in the world of
nutrition and food science, in the belief that they will continue to learn
about nutrition and food long after they have left secondary school as
a matter of necessity, hobby or professional pursuit.</p>
<p>Through the planned inclusion of Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL), Collaborative
Learning (CoL) and Experiential Learning (ExL) in the crafting of our curriculum,
our students will develop their skills through a series of culinary challenges
designed to encourage critical and creative thinking in the selection and
preparation of food for different purposes in life.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Programmes</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Authentic &amp; experiential learning experiences through:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>A wide range of thematic questions exposing students to a range of topics,
skills and methods, for example, different types of food commodities, food
science experiments, methods of cooking and health trends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opportunities to learn beyond the classroom, for example, themed food
competitions, workshops and&nbsp; talks by professionals in the food industry.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cross-disciplinary learning through collaboration with other departments</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Our Lower Secondary students see connections between Food &amp; Consumer
Education (FCE) and Outdoor Education lessons in Physical Education (PE)
when they apply what they have learnt about food safety and cooking in
FCE to outdoor cooking.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Self-directed learning through the use of information and communication
technology</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Students are able to carry out their FCE learning independently using
Google Classroom and SLS.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>"Today, we learned how to make a fruit compote using the reduction method,
bake a chocolate cake using the creaming method, and prepare a light, delicious
cream for decorating the cake.</p>
<p>This cake was designed with teens in mind! The berry compote is packed
with fruits like strawberries and raspberries, which are rich in essential
vitamins and minerals, perfect for supporting a healthy diet. The dish
also has vibrant colors, making it visually appealing for teens.</p>
<p>We especially enjoyed the cake decorating process, as it gave us a chance
to showcase our creativity."</p>
