#### **Overview**


SJC’s instructional programme is guided by our Character-Building belief that **_Every Student is Talented and Will Experience Success_**. As such, we customise our curriculum to meet the needs of our diverse student population in the different academic streams to enable them to attain value-added academic results. Building upon the Singapore Teaching Practice (STP), we adopt a variety of pedagogical approaches which include Differentiation, Socratic Questioning, Formative Assessment, Inquiry-Based teaching and Concept-Based teaching to stimulate discussion and learning in and out of the classroom.
