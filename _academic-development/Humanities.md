#### **Our Objectives**

*   To inspire the passion for Humanities in students and help them understand the interconnectedness of Singapore and the world and relevance in their learning.
*   To equip students with critical thinking skills and 21st century competencies that will allow them to thrive in an increasingly complex world.
*   To nurture students who are concerned and active citizens committed to contribute to the society and world they live in.

#### **Our Approach**


**_1\. Key pedagogies: Inquiry-based & Issue-based Learning in the Humanities Curriculum_**

*   Use of questions, problems, and scenarios to spark curiosity among students and help them learn through their own investigation and reflection. These approaches help to encourage critical thinking, investigation and problem-solving in the exploration of questions or issues. Students would be equipped with 21st century skills to become independent and self-directed learners.
*   Facilitation by teachers to guide students’ thinking and help them make sense of the wealth of information available to them.
*   Geographical, Historical and Social Studies Issue Investigations through field-based and experiential learning offer opportunities for students to engage in the inquiry process.

**_2\. Nurturing the passion for Humanities_**

*    Nurture the passion for Humanities through various experiential learning opportunities such as learning journeys (e.g. visit to Old Ford Factory Museum and LTA Gallery) and enrichment programmes (e.g. Historical Scene Investigation Challenge by NLB and NUS Geography Challenge).

*    Make learning of Humanities meaningful by deepening students’ disciplinary understanding and engaging students in discussion of real-world issues associated with the Humanities.
