#### **Our Objectives**


*   To nurture students' interest and passion in Mathematics.
*   To maximize students' potential through a rigorous Mathematics curriculum.

#### **Our Approach**


Mathematics is the study of the&nbsp;**_properties_**,&nbsp;**_relationships_**,&nbsp;**_operations_**,&nbsp;**_algorithms_**, and&nbsp;**_applications_**&nbsp;of numbers and spaces at the very basic levels, and of&nbsp;**_abstract objects and concepts_**&nbsp;at the more advanced levels.

Mathematics is largely hierarchical in nature.&nbsp;**Higher concepts and skills are built upon the more foundational ones**&nbsp;and have to be&nbsp;**learned in sequence**.

  

In SJC, a&nbsp;**spiral approach**&nbsp;is adopted in the building up of mathematical contents across the levels. The mathematics curriculum consists of a set of&nbsp;**connected syllabuses**&nbsp;to cater to the different needs and abilities of our students.

#### **Our Programmes**


##### **Core Curriculum**

For the lower secondary level, some students are offered Maths Subject Based Banding (SBB) where they have the opportunity to stretch themselves in learning Mathematics at a higher rigour.&nbsp;

  
At the upper secondary level, Additional Mathematics is offered to students who have an aptitude and interest in Mathematics to acquire mathematical concepts and skills for higher studies in Mathematics and to support learning in the other subjects, in particular, the sciences.

 ##### **Enrichment Programme**

*   To complement the content of Mathematics taught in the classroom, enrichment activities are organised for our students to help them discover new things about their communities, sharpen their mathematical thinking and provide a platform for them to apply their mathematical skills to solving problems in the real world. These activities also aim to cultivate in students an interest and passion for Mathematics.

*   Our lower secondary students participate in the annual Mathematics Trail designed and executed by our Maths teachers. Students work in teams to explore interesting and challenging mathematical concepts as they learn to apply problem solving skills on real-world tasks. These trails encourage our students to put on their critical thinking caps to make analytical decisions while allowing them to seek a deeper understanding and passion in the subject. Technology is incorporated in the trails, allowing for greater collaborative learning experiences.

#### **Competitions**

Whenever opportunities arise, selected students will be enrolled in Math competitions. Through competing in an external environment, studentsâ€™ learning of the subject is broadened as they solve complex and challenging mathematical problems. The exposure and experience also help students to develop critical thinking and problem solving skills. Some of the competitions that our students have participated in are:

(a) Singapore Mathematics Olympiad (SMO)

(b) International Mathematical Modelling Challenge (IMMC)

(c) All Singapore Secondary Mathematics Competition for Normal Course Students
