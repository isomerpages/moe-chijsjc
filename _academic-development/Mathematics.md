<h4><strong>Our Objectives</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To nurture students' interest and passion in Mathematics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To maximize students' potential through a rigorous Mathematics curriculum.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Our Approach</strong></h4>
<p>Mathematics is the study of the&nbsp;<strong><em>properties</em></strong>,&nbsp;<strong><em>relationships</em></strong>,&nbsp;<strong><em>operations</em></strong>,&nbsp;<strong><em>algorithms</em></strong>,
and&nbsp;<strong><em>applications</em></strong>&nbsp;of numbers and spaces
at the very basic levels, and of&nbsp;<strong><em>abstract objects and concepts</em></strong>&nbsp;at
the more advanced levels.</p>

<p>Mathematics is largely hierarchical in nature.&nbsp;<strong>Higher concepts and skills are built upon the more foundational ones</strong>&nbsp;and
have to be&nbsp;<strong>learned in sequence</strong>.</p>
<p>In SJC, a&nbsp;<strong>spiral approach</strong>&nbsp;is adopted in the
building up of mathematical contents across the levels. The mathematics
curriculum consists of a set of&nbsp;<strong>connected syllabuses</strong>&nbsp;to
cater to the different needs and abilities of our students.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Programmes</strong></h4>
<h5><strong>Core Curriculum</strong></h5>
<p>For the lower secondary level, some students are offered Maths at More
Demanding Level (MDL) where they have the opportunity to stretch themselves
in learning Mathematics at a higher rigour.</p>
<p>At the upper secondary level, Additional Mathematics is offered to students
who have an aptitude and interest in Mathematics to acquire mathematical
concepts and skills for higher studies in Mathematics and to support learning
in the other subjects, in particular, the sciences.</p>
<h5><strong>Enrichment Programme</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To complement the content of Mathematics taught in the classroom, enrichment
activities are organised for our students to help them discover new things
about their communities, sharpen their mathematical thinking and provide
a platform for them to apply their mathematical skills to solving problems
in the real world. These activities also aim to cultivate in students an
interest and passion for Mathematics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our lower secondary students participate in the annual Mathematics Trail
designed and executed by our Maths teachers. Students work in teams to
explore interesting and challenging mathematical concepts as they learn
to apply problem solving skills on real-world tasks. These trails encourage
our students to put on their critical thinking caps to make analytical
decisions while allowing them to seek a deeper understanding and passion
in the subject. Technology is incorporated in the trails, allowing for
greater collaborative learning experiences. In 2024, an interdisciplinary
trail was carried out where students were given the opportunity to see
the application of different subjects (including Math) in the real world.</p>

<h4><strong>Competitions</strong></h4>
<p>Whenever opportunities arise, selected students will be enrolled in Math
competitions. Through competing in an external environment, studentsâ€™ learning
of the subject is broadened as they solve complex and challenging mathematical
problems. The exposure and experience also help students to develop critical
thinking and problem solving skills. Some of the competitions that our
students have participated in are:</p>
<p>(a) Singapore Mathematics Olympiad (SMO)</p>
<p>(b) International Mathematical Modelling Challenge (IMMC)</p>
<p>(c) All Singapore Secondary Mathematics Competition for Normal Course
Students</p>
