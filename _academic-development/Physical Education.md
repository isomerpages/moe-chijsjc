<h4><strong>Our Objective</strong></h4>
<p>To nurture in every SJCian a love for lifelong, healthy and active living.</p>
<p>The PE Department strives to develop students holistically, equipping
them with the knowledge, skills, and values to lead active, purposeful
lives. Through varied and meaningful learning experiences, every student
learns to move with confidence, think reflectively, and care for others
through the joy of physical activity.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Approach</strong></h4>
<p>Anchored in the national Physical Education (PE) syllabus, our curriculum
provides purposeful and progressive learning experiences that help students
think, move, and live actively.</p>
<p>We adopt a concept-based and game-centered approach, enabling learning
to be transferable across different games and contexts. Lessons are intentionally
designed to strengthen teamwork, resilience, and sportsmanship, shaping
both skill and character.</p>
<p>Our programmes also integrate Outdoor Education (OE) and Physical Health
&amp; Safety (PHS) to build students’ confidence, adaptability, and well-being.
Students learn how to eat well, sleep well, stay active, and care for themselves
and others, developing lifelong habits of health and safety in physical
activity and daily living.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Programme</strong></h4>
<p>In line with the national PE syllabus, our curriculum comprises three
key learning areas taught across all levels:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Sports &amp; Games (Physical Activities)</strong>
<br>Students experience a range of sports such as frisbee, netball, floorball,
pickleball, badminton, and handball. Lessons focus on developing movement
competence and game understanding while nurturing collaboration, resilience,
and sportsmanship.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Outdoor Education (OE)</strong>
<br>Students acquire skills such as orienteering, outdoor cooking, and shelter
building, applying them during the Secondary 1 and 3 Outdoor Adventure
Learning (OAL) Camps. These authentic experiences foster confidence, adaptability,
and appreciation for nature, while cultivating responsibility for self,
others, and the environment.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong> Physical Health &amp; Safety (PHS)</strong>
<br>Students learn to plan and monitor their own fitness routines, understand
the importance of balanced nutrition, adequate rest, and safe participation
in physical activities. This promotes self-directedness and ownership of
personal well-being.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To broaden students’ exposure and deepen their appreciation of active
living, the department also offers enrichment experiences through the Sports
Education Programme (SEP) and the ActiveSG School Sports Partnership (SSP).
These initiatives provide opportunities for students to participate in
accessible and engaging activities beyond the regular curriculum. Through
SEP, students are introduced to sports such as rope skipping, archery,
and inline skating, encouraging them to explore new interests and pursue
active lifestyles beyond school. Under the SSP, students take part in street
dance enrichment, which helps them develop body awareness, rhythm, and
self-confidence through creative movement. Together, these programmes complement
the PE curriculum by nurturing active, confident, and well-rounded individuals.</p>
<p>Department- and school-wide events such as the Skill-Fit Challenge, Inter-Class
Games, Sports Carnival, and Urban Run further extend learning beyond the
classroom. These events provide authentic opportunities for students to
apply what they have learnt, celebrate active living, and build a shared
culture of health and well-being within the school community.

<h4><strong>Growing Student Leaders</strong></h4>
<p>The Sports Leaders form an integral part of the department’s student leadership
development. As Health and Wellness Ambassadors, they work closely with
the PE Department to champion active living and strengthen the sporting
culture within the school.</p>
<p>Through structured training and hands-on experiences, Sports Leaders help
plan and lead in various health and wellness initiatives, support events
such as the Urban Run and Inter-Class Games, and serve as positive role
models among their peers. These authentic leadership opportunities empower
students to exercise voice, choice, and ownership in shaping a healthier
and more active school community.</p>
<p>In nurturing these leaders, the department aims to develop confident,
empathetic, and resilient individuals who take ownership of their well-being
and inspire others to live well and stay active, embodying what it means
to lead with both health and heart.</p>
