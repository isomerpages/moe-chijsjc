#### **Our Approach**


*   Our key focus is for students to gain a deeper appreciation for Science through experiential learning, with links to real-life scenarios and applications in STEM context.
*   Varied teaching methods and thinking routines, which are catered to our students’ learning needs, are used to engage them during daily lessons.
