#### **About**


Badminton CCA nurtures students into resilient and effective all-rounders through our bi-weekly training and the various programmes put in place throughout the year. Besides learning basic badminton skills, players do weekly runs to build their physical and mental strength. Tactical application and game management are taught to enable players to perform to their best ability during competitions.

  

Players are also given opportunities to develop leadership skills when they help in organising CCA-based and school-based events.

  

Our team is a close-knit family that encourages one another through their journey together as players strive for excellence both in their CCA and studies.
