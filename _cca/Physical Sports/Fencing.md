#### **About**


The art of fencing provides a rigorous physical and mental workout. Fencing boosts both cardiovascular strength and concentration levels, and is an ideal sport for any student. It is a unique sport which combines elegance with speed, assertiveness, discipline and deception.

  

CHIJ SJC’s Fencing Club started since 1996, and our students have enjoyed taking part in national schools competitions and exchange programme with schools in a sports CCA that not many schools have.
