#### **About**


SJC Netball has a long and rich tradition in the school. The team is blessed with generations of SJC netballers who were and are closely linked to the CCA, coming back often to contribute to the school and reconnect with the school through past vs present friendly games. Netball at SJC is a top performing sports CCA and a strong powerhouse against other school teams. The CCA has come a long way to establish itself as a reputable and worthy opponent in both the Zonal and National Schools Tournaments.

  

At SJC, a comprehensive values-driven Netball Programme is tailored as team members learn what it means to be a committed and responsible team player who communicates effectively and takes ownership of the sport. With the fervent support of the school and coach, our players have demonstrated the ability to develop into well-rounded student-athletes who excel both on the court and in the classroom. The team remains close-knitted today and see one another as one SJC Netball Family.
