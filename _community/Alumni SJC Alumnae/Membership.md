Dear Josephians,

  

The St. Joseph’s Convent Alumnae is looking for new members, and we need YOU! 

  

You may ask, Why Join the Alumnae? For What Purpose? How does it benefit me? Well, the Alumnae aims to:

  

1.  Promote a spirit of friendship and mutual co-operation among members.
2.  Establish a continuing link with our alma mater and help SJC in whatever way it can (e.g. giving aid/assistance to the needy and less fortunate students, supporting the school by giving career talks, interviewing students for awards).  
    
3.  Promote and organise social/cultural activities (like get-togethers, annual dinners, talks) to keep alumnae connected to the school.  
    

  

The current committee is excited about welcoming new members into the fold to chart our next chapter. It is only with your generous help that we can do more for our alma mater.

  

If you are keen to support SJC and our mission, please complete and return the application form and cheque to:

  

CHIJ St. Joseph’s Convent  
62 Sengkang East Way  
Singapore 548595

  

Your Sincerely,

  

Aruna Johnson   
President, CHIJ SJC Alumnae Association, 2021-2022
