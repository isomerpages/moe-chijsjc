#### **Aesthetics**


In Aesthetics, we seek to develop our students to be independent and creative learners who possess an awareness and appreciation of art and music in varied forms.  

#### **Aesthetics – Art**




#### **Our Objectives:**


*   To provide meaningful and authentic art learning experiences that nurture students’ creativity and appreciation for the visual arts. 
*   To develop creative expressions through individual and collaborative art making

#### **Our Approach:**


Students learn art through:  

*   An investigative, student-centered inquiry-based learning approach that focuses on their research, idea development, analysis of artworks, and art- making processes. 

#### **Our Programme:**


In the lower secondary art curriculum, students learn to **Perceive**, **Communicate** and **Appreciate** through the learning of the:  

  

*   **Context of Artmaking** – conditions that lead to the ideas of the work and why works are created in certain ways
*   **Artistic Processes** – methods that artists use to gather and develop ideas for the works
*   **Media** – how to use materials, tools and techniques
*   **Visual Qualities** – how to use elements or art and principles of design to create desired effects

  

In the upper secondary art curriculum, students develop their technical and explorative skills through exposure to various 2D and 3D art media. The students deepen and develop their appreciation of, interest and critical thinking in art through the affordances of ICT, experiential learning journeys to art institutions and organizations, as well as art enrichment workshops.

  

Students at all levels also benefit from the Artist in School Scheme (AISS), where professional artists conduct talks and master classes for students to engage them further in different genres of art. To encourage our budding artists, students’ work-in-progress are also celebrated monthly. The “Artists of the Month” affirms students’ creativity and highlights our emphasis on the process of art learning than the finished product.
