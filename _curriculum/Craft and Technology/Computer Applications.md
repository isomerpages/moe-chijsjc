##### **Our Approach**


*   Key pedagogical approach includes

1.  students learning through doing where they design and create computational artefacts, generate solutions to tasks/ problems and examine computer programmes
2.  students learning through solving authentic problems by using the Stop-Think-Act-Review approach

*   Building responsibility in our students using the Responsibility Instructional Approach to develop our students as self-directed and collaborative learners.
