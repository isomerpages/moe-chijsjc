<h4><strong>About</strong></h4>
<p>The CHIJ Youth Mission (IJYM) is a distinctive Co-Curricular Activity
(CCA) that holds significance for us, as well as four other CHIJ schools,
namely CHIJ Secondary (Toa Payoh), CHIJ St. Nicholas Girls’ School, CHIJ
St. Theresa’s Convent, and CHIJ Katong. The CCA seeks to provide an enabling
environment for girls to recognise and promote the dignity of human persons
especially the disadvantaged.</p>
<p>This shared vision strengthens the bonds between our school and our sister
schools, as our actions reflect the IJ mission. We participate in annual
IJYM events, such as the CHIJ Youth Mission Inter-School competition with
the other four IJ schools, to showcase our community service and programme
for the year.</p>
<p>Every year, we embark on projects based on the year’s theme, which is
chosen based on an annual rotation system. The theme for this year (2023)
is "Hoping Against Hope”. We strive to give back to the community as we
develop empathy for the disadvantaged and seek to help them in any way
possible.</p>
<p>Through this process of learning and growth, members are transformed by
the experience of servant leadership while listening to the needs of others.</p>
<h4><strong>Objectives</strong></h4>
<p>Through its projects and activities, IJYM members</p>
<p>1) gain a greater understanding of society and learn to put themselves
in the shoes of the disadvantaged.</p>
<p>2. learn to work for the greater good of society.</p>
<p>3. learn the importance of taking the initiative to help our society in
any way possible, both within and outside the CCA.</p>
