#### **About**
CHIJ Youth Mission (IJYM) is a unique Co-Curricular Activity, that is special to us, as well as four other IJ Schools (CHIJ Secondary (Toa Payoh), CHIJ St. Nicholas Girls’ School, CHIJ St. Theresa’s Convent, and CHIJ Katong). IJYM aims to provide an enabling environment for girls to recognise and promote the dignity of human persons especially the disadvantaged.

This shared vision strengthens the bonds between our sister schools, as we reflect the IJ mission in all that we do. We participate in annual IJYM events, such as the CHIJ Youth Mission Inter-School competition with the other four IJ schools, to showcase our community service and programme for the year.

Every year, we embark on our projects based on the year’s theme, which is chosen based on an annual rotation system. The theme for this year (2023) is "Hoping Against Hope”. We endeavour to give back to the community as we develop empathy for the disadvantaged and seek to assist them in any way possible.

Through this process of learning and growth, members are transformed by the experience of servant leadership while listening to the needs of others.

#### **Objectives**
 1.  Through the projects and activities carried out by IJYM,  members are exposed to learning more about the society and putting themselves in the shoes of the minority. They will then learn how to work and provide help to the needs of the society. For example, through our project Advocacy For Refugees (AFR), members are able to be exposed to what the refugees face during their difficulties and unpack what kind of difficulties they faced. Using this knowledge, members are able to spread awareness to the other students, to encourage their spirit to serve the society.
2.  As more activities are carried out, we hope that:
(a) Members learn to work for the good of society
(b) Members learn the importance of taking the initiative to take action and help our society in any way possible, in and outside of the CCA
