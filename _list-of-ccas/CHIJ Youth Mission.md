#### **About**
CHIJ Youth Mission (IJYM) is a unique Co-Curricular Activity, that is special to us, as well as four other IJ Schools (CHIJ Secondary (Toa Payoh), CHIJ St. Nicholas Girls’ School, CHIJ St. Theresa’s Convent, and CHIJ Katong), that provides an enabling environment for girls to recognise and promote the dignity of human persons especially the disadvantaged.

This shared vision strengthens the bonds between our sister schools, as we reflect the IJ mission in all that we do. We participate in annual IJYM events, such as the CHIJ Youth Mission Inter-School competition with the other four IJ schools, to showcase our community service and programme for the year.

Every year, we embark on our projects based on the year’s theme, which is chosen based on an annual rotation system. The theme for this year (2023) is "Hoping Against Hope”. We strive to do our best to give back to the community, as we learn to empathise with the less fortunate, and try to find ways to best aid them in whatever way we can.
Every year, we start our projects based on the year's theme, which is chosen based on an annual rotation system; the theme for this year (2023) is "Hoping Against Hope." We work hard to give back to the community as we develop empathy for the underprivileged and look for opportunities to help them in any manner we can.

Our activities include meaningful community involvement programmes like fund raising projects for the needy and volunteering at Homes for the Elderly. Members are transformed by the experience of servant leadership and grow as they listen to the needs of others in their community.

  

The CHIJ Youth Mission is a CCA special to the school and the four other IJ Schools, CHIJ Toa Payoh (Secondary), CHIJ St. Nicholas, CHIJ St. Theresa's, and CHIJ Katong. This bond shared by the CHIJ schools reflects the IJ mission and vision that belongs to all the IJ schools as all IJ Youth Mission members in the school are provided with the opportunity to participate in the annual IJ Youth Mission Inter-School competition to showcase our community service and programme for the year.
