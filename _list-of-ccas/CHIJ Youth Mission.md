#### **About**
The CHIJ Youth Mission (IJYM) is a distinctive Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) that holds significance for us, as well as four other CHIJ schools, namely CHIJ Secondary (Toa Payoh), CHIJ St. Nicholas Girls’ School, CHIJ St. Theresa’s Convent, and CHIJ Katong. The CCA seeks to provide an enabling environment for girls to recognise and promote the dignity of human persons especially the disadvantaged.

This shared vision strengthens the bonds between our school and our sister schools, as our actions reflect the IJ mission. We participate in annual IJYM events, such as the CHIJ Youth Mission Inter-School competition with the other four IJ schools, to showcase our community service and programme for the year.

Every year, we embark on projects based on the year’s theme, which is chosen based on an annual rotation system. The theme for this year (2023) is "Hoping Against Hope”. We strive to give back to the community as we develop empathy for the disadvantaged and seek to help them in any way possible.

Through this process of learning and growth, members are transformed by the experience of servant leadership while listening to the needs of others.

#### **Objectives**
 Through its projects and activities, IJYM members
1) gain a greater understanding of society and learn to put themselves in the shoes of the disadvantaged. 
2. learn to work for the greater good of society.
3. learn the importance of taking the initiative to help our society in any way possible, both within and outside the CCA.


#### **Activities**
1.  Partnerships with external organisations
2. Events with the other 4 IJ schools
3. School-based events/projects
