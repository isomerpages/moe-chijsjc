#### **About**


The CHIJ Youth Mission provides an enabling environment for girls to recognize and promote the dignity of human persons, especially the disadvantaged.


Our activities include meaningful community involvement programmes like fund raising projects for the needy and volunteering at Homes for the Elderly. Members are transformed by the experience of servant leadership and grow as they listen to the needs of others in their community.

  

The CHIJ Youth Mission is a CCA special to the school and the four other IJ Schools, CHIJ Toa Payoh (Secondary), CHIJ St. Nicholas, CHIJ St. Theresa's, and CHIJ Katong. This bond shared by the CHIJ schools reflects the IJ mission and vision that belongs to all the IJ schools as all IJ Youth Mission members in the school are provided with the opportunity to participate in the annual IJ Youth Mission Inter-School competition to showcase our community service and programme for the year.
