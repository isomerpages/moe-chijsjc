<h4><strong>About</strong></h4>
<p>CentreStage is a fun-filled CCA where students are provided with a platform
to express themselves eloquently, articulately and persuasively. During
their weekly sessions, they are taught fundamental skills in drama and
debates. In drama, they are trained to develop adaptive skills to improvise
and be quick-witted. In debates, students are challenged to step out of
their comfort zones and think out of the box in order to craft a convincing
argument for their speeches. In both sessions, through both drama and debate,
students engage in in-depth discussion about current affairs and social
issues, allowing students to foster a deeper understanding of the world
around them.</p>
<p>By the end of their time in the CCA, students realise that drama and debates
go beyond acting and debating. They also acquire soft skills that develop
their time-management and communication abilities, while allowing their
self-confidence to flourish. Most importantly, students learn to be open-minded
and accept each other's differences, while having fun and bonding as a
CCA.</p>
