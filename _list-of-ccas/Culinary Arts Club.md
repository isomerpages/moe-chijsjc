<h4><strong>About</strong></h4>
<p>The Culinary Arts Club is a platform where students experience hands-on
sessions on the art of food preparation, cooking, presentation and serving.
However, we do not just prepare palatable food, pleasing to the eye. Our
members also conduct research on themes, present their findings and reflect
on processes too.</p>
<p>We also organize learning journeys to a variety of places related to food
resources such as local farms, markets and restaurants to broaden our culinary
knowledge and further our culinary adventures. We learn much and are often
challenged to step out of our comfort zone. We believe that these activities
will allow our club members to grow and deepen the skills and passion of
our budding chefs! The Culinary Arts Club encourages camaraderie and strives
to work together efficiently, to live up to our motto:&nbsp;<strong>BAKE. EAT. LOVE</strong>
