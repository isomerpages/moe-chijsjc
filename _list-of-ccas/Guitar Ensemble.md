<h4><strong>About</strong></h4>
<p>The Guitar Ensemble was established by a small group of guitar enthusiasts
in 2004. Through the years, membership has grown and members learn a wide
range of repertoire that includes classical to contemporary pieces as well
as Latin pieces like "Flamenco Farruca”.</p>
<p>Apart from participating in the biennial Singapore Youth Festival Arts
Presentation, the ensemble performs in public concerts and at various school
events. The CCA collaborates with other music CCAs and interacts with guitarists
from other schools at exchange programmes.</p>
<p>Through the various performances and practices, SJC Guitar Ensemble members
are given opportunities to develop their passion and stretch their musical
potential. As the members hone their skills, they build their confidence
and develop a sense of team spirit while constantly striving for excellence
in all that they do.</p>
