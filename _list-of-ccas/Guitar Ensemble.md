#### **About**

The Guitar Ensemble was established by a small group of guitar enthusiasts in 2004. Through the years, membership has grown and members learn a wide range of repertoire that includes classical to contemporary pieces as well as Latin pieces like "Flamenco Farruca”.  

Apart from participating in the biennial Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation, the ensemble performs in public concerts and at various school events. The CCA collaborates with other music CCAs and interacts with guitarists from other schools at exchange programmes. 

Through the various performances and practices, SJC Guitar Ensemble members are given opportunities to develop their passion and stretch their musical potential. As the members hone their skills, they build their confidence and develop a sense of team spirit while constantly striving for excellence in all that they do.
