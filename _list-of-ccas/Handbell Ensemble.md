#### **About**
   
The SJC Handbell Ensemble has been ringing with joy and gratitude since 2006 when it was first formed with a small group of 22 students. Since then, the group of ringers has expanded to form an ensemble twice its original size. Proud to sustain a culture of excellence through the commendable list of achievements from participation in the biennial Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation, this ensemble strives to bring its best to all performances.

As the ringers ring their assigned bells, they create beautiful melodies together as an ensemble. Through time spent together, they enjoy friendship and build on the strengths of one another. The resulting camaraderie allows the ringers to work and strive for the best through their commonly shared values of commitment, team-work, and discipline. The SJC Handbell Ensemble hopes to touch the lives of its audience with its melodious and angelic tunes of handbells and handchimes.

#### **Objectives**   
*   To learn a new musical instrument.
