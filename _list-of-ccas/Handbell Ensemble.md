<h4><strong>About</strong></h4>
<p>The SJC Handbell Ensemble has been ringing with joy and gratitude since
2006 when it was first formed with a small group of 22 students. Since
then, the group of ringers has expanded to form an ensemble twice its original
size. Proud to sustain a culture of excellence through the commendable
list of achievements from participation in the biennial Singapore Youth
Festival Arts Presentation, this ensemble strives to bring its best to
all performances.</p>
<p>As the ringers ring their assigned bells, they create beautiful melodies
together as an ensemble. Through time spent together, they enjoy friendship
and build on the strengths of one another. The resulting camaraderie allows
the ringers to work and strive for the best through their commonly shared
values of commitment, team-work, and discipline. The SJC Handbell Ensemble
hopes to touch the lives of its audience with its melodious and angelic
tunes of handbells and handchimes.</p>
