<h4><strong>About</strong></h4>
<p>SJC NPCC Unit was started in the late 1960s as one of the two uniformed
group CCAs in the former school site in Hillside Drive and functioned until
the mid-1980s before the CCA was closed. The unit was re-started in 1999.
It has since grown in strength in membership and in our quality of programmes,
achieving excellent results as a unit and in numerous areas.</p>
<p>The unit has consistently done well to attain the annual Unit Overall
Proficiency Award since its eligibility in 2003 – Silver (2003 to 2005
&amp; 2013 – 2014) and Gold (2006 – 2012, 2015 – 2017).&nbsp; In addition,
at least 1 outstanding cadet also attained the SPF NPCC Award, the pinnacle
award for NPCC cadets.</p>
<p>Our NPCC’s four-year programme offers a wide range of activities such
as drills, weapons training, self-defence tactics, outdoor camps, crime
scene investigation training as well as community involvement projects.
The unit works hand in hand with the Singapore Police Force to promote
a safe and secure Singapore through workshops and programmes such as Police
Youth Ambassador. Cadets are also provided with opportunities to represent
the unit to take part in various inter-unit competitions to bring glory
to the unit. Activities such as local education visits and Values-in-Action
(ViA) activities are also organised annually to develop our cadets holistically
to be concerned citizens. Leadership development opportunities abound within
the CCA and at HQ level to develop our cadets further.</p>
<p>The tradition to pursue excellence runs through all aspects of SJC NPCC
training, inculcating in our cadets a strong sense of discipline, integrity,
resourcefulness and confidence as we develop them into responsible individuals
capable of facing any new challenges that may arise.</p>
<p>The 6As – namely Aware, Acquire, Actuate, Aspire, Achieve and Aim – defines
the progressive learning path of a cadet from a new recruit at Secondary
One to a youth leader and an officer. It also identifies the six desired
training outcomes of its programmes.</p>
