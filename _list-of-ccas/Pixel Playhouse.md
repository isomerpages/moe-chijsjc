#### **About**

At Pixel Playhouse, students are offered opportunities to explore and develop their interests in photography, videography, photo-editing, storyboarding and Audio Visual (AV) through a range of programmes and competitions. Students hone their skills by attending workshops, participating in national schools competition, providing photography, videography and AV support for school events.

One key competition that members of the Pixel Playhouse participate in is *N.E.mation!,* organised by Singapore Discovery Centre for students and youths to express their thoughts about Total Defence. In the past years, we have seen at least one team making it to the top 20 finalists, with one team winning First Runner Up in *N.E.mation! 2022!*
