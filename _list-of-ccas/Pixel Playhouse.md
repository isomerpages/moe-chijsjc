#### **About**


At Pixel Playhouse, students are offered an opportunity to explore their interests in photography, videography, storyboarding, social media and Public Announcement (PA) through a range of exciting programmes. Students hone their skills by attending workshops, participating in national schools competitions, providing photography, videography and PA support for all school events and exposure to authentic learning through learning journeys and on-the-job project works.

  

A key strength of the CCA is our participation in the annual digital animation competition organised by Nexus for students and youth to express their thoughts about Total Defence. The past 3 years have seen at least 1 team making it to the top 10 finalists and some teams reaching the top 100 or top 40 teams amongst hundreds of teams from schools in Singapore.

  

At Pixel, we believe in being effective, organised and giving our best in all that we do and thus our motto –&nbsp;**_Winning Every Moment_**.
