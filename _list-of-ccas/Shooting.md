<h4>Highlights</h4>
<p>The Shooting Team had an exciting year filled with achievements and camaraderie.
Students participated in the NTU and NUS Invitational Shoots, with the
B Division Air Pistol Women securing 2nd place at the NTU Shoot, and Eunice
Khoo earning first place individually. Our shooters then competed fiercely
in the National School Games for both B and C Divisions, where Eunice advanced
to the B Division final round. During the June holidays, the team enjoyed
a friendly exchange with Raffles Girls Shooting Team at their shooting
range, fostering strong bonds and mutual learning. It was a memorable year
of skill, teamwork, and friendship for all involved.</p>
