<h4><strong>About</strong></h4>
<p>In Shooting, members develop self-discipline and focus through a structured
and engaging sport. Before engaging in dry firing and live firing at the
school range, students undergo physical training to build strength and
endurance, essential for maintaining steady aim and control.</p>
<p>Additionally, they learn and apply sports psychological skills such as
relaxation techniques, which help them stay calm and composed under pressure,
and visualization techniques, which enable them to mentally rehearse and
perfect their performance. This combination of physical preparation and
mental conditioning makes shooting an excellent activity for fostering
a disciplined and focused mindset in students.</p>
<p>Some of our student athletes have demonstrated remarkable skill and tenacity,
culminating in their advancement to the Finals in the recent National Shooting
Games Championships. Through consistent effort and unwavering focus, these
students have excelled in their respective categories, showcasing their
talent and commitment on a national platform.&nbsp;</p>
