#### **About**


In Sports Club, we believe in Promoting Values Through Sports.&nbsp; &nbsp;Through the Sports Club experience, members learn to play a variety of sports, such as Tchoukball, Floorball and Ultimate Frisbee.&nbsp; They also participate in several outdoor activities such as Orienteering and Kayaking.&nbsp; Student Leaders in Sports Club are given opportunities to plan and lead trainings for the junior members, to help them hone their leadership skills.&nbsp; Our members also have opportunities to represent the school in competitions such as the National Inter-School Tchoukball Competitions, National Orienteering Competition and N1 Cluster Games.

We also believe in using sports to serve the community.&nbsp; Our members assist in organizing school-wide sports events, such as Track and Field and Inter-Class Games.&nbsp; We also work with community organisations to undertake Values-In-Action projects, to promote healthy lifestyles to the public.

Through these activities, our members learn perseverance, teamwork and to give their best.&nbsp; They also develop civic-mindedness, by leveraging on their strengths to serve the community.&nbsp; Just as importantly, they build lasting friendships with fellow members in the CCA.
