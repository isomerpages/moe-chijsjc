#### **About**


The St John Brigade (SJB) is a voluntary organisation in Singapore which provides training in First Aid, Home Nursing and Foot Drill. St John members also perform voluntary first aid coverage duties during school and national events.

  

The St John Brigade (SJB), formerly known as St John Ambulance Brigade (SJAB) has a deep rooted history as a core UG CCA in SJC as early as the 1970s. The CCA provides opportunities for personal development, character building and leadership training through the varied activities offered. SJB cadets learn basic first aid knowledge, which includes Home Nursing and Basic/Advanced CPR techniques. They also engage in vigorous foot-drill and physical training sessions to build up their stamina. They apply the skills learnt in annual Zonal and National competitions. Participation in these competitions, leadership courses and enrichment activities provide opportunities to maximize our cadets’ potential in these areas.
