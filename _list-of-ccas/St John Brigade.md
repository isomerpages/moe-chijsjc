#### **About**

In St John Brigade (SJB), cadets participate in three main components: first aid and life support, home nursing and foot drill. We aim to develop cadets holistically with a strong emphasis on values and character development, as well as leadership. The first aid knowledge that cadets learn goes on to serve them well as a life skill, sparkling an interest in some to pursue medicine or nursing as their career.

To forge stronger ties as a corps, regular bonding sessions and activities are held and cadets are encouraged to participate in the Cadet Proficiency Badge Scheme to support their development beyond SJB.

#### **Objectives**

*   To equip our cadets to be a competent trained first-aider to render First Aid and Home Nursing to those in need through life-saving skills of first aid, nursing, and emergency assistance.
*   To ensure each cadet attains proficiency in First Aid, Home Nursing and Foot Drill.
*   To provide a meaningful holistic 4-year CCA experience through purposeful and engaging activities.
*   To develop leadership skills, independence, team building skills, resilience and good character.
*    To strive for all of our cadets to graduate with the Chief Commissioner's Badge, which represents the greatest standard of achievement for a a cadet.
