#### **OVERVIEW**

Education and Career Guidance (ECG) is about equipping students with the necessary knowledge, skills, and values to make informed decisions at each key education stage for successful transition from school to further education or work, so that they can manage their education and career pathways and practise lifelong learning throughout their lives.&nbsp;By nurturing self-awareness and self-directedness for lifelong learning, ECG helps students develop a growth mindset, adaptability and a resilient attitude to embrace future opportunities and appreciate all occupations across society.

ECG is developmental in nature and seeks to meet the developmental needs of students at every stage of education. The emphasis for Primary schools is on&nbsp;**Awareness**, for Secondary schools on&nbsp;**Exploration**, and for Upper Secondary and post-Secondary levels on&nbsp;**Planning**.

Learn about ECG and the resources available to support students in their journey from school to further education or work&nbsp;[here](https://www.moe.gov.sg/education-in-sg/our-programmes/education-and-career-guidance/overview).

#### **OUR OBJECTIVES**
In SJC, ECG aims to:  
      
1.  Nurture students’ self-awareness and self-directedness for lifelong learning
2.  Enable students to explore education and career options, by equipping them with skills and resources to source for information   
3.  Create opportunities for students to build positive connections with the community (such as teachers, ECG counsellors, parents, industry partners), to develop an appreciation for different career pathways; and    
4.  Help students develop a growth mindset, a resilient attitude to embrace future opportunities, and appreciate all occupations across society.
