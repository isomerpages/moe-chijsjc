<h4><strong>OVERVIEW</strong></h4>
<p>Education and Career Guidance (ECG) is about equipping students with the
necessary knowledge, skills, and values to make informed decisions at each
key education stage for successful transition from school to further education
or work, so that they can manage their education and career pathways and
practise lifelong learning throughout their lives.&nbsp;By nurturing self-awareness
and self-directedness for lifelong learning, ECG helps students develop
a growth mindset, adaptability and a resilient attitude to embrace future
opportunities and appreciate all occupations across society.</p>
<p>ECG is developmental in nature and seeks to meet the developmental needs
of students at every stage of education. The emphasis for Primary schools
is on&nbsp;<strong>Awareness</strong>, for Secondary schools on&nbsp;<strong>Exploration</strong>,
and for Upper Secondary and post-Secondary levels on&nbsp;<strong>Planning</strong>.</p>

<p>In addition, all students take part in <strong>Passion Ignite</strong> as
part of ECG. This is dedicated time for them to carry out their Student-Initiated
Learning (SIL) on Home-Based Learning (HBL) days for them to pursue their
own interests and learn outside the curriculum. Students can use the time
to pick up knowledge or skills to delve deeper into their areas of interest,
or explore areas they are curious about to broaden their exposure. Selected
students will present and share their Passion Ignite journey at SIL Showcase.
Through this, we hope to encourage students to become self-directed and
lifelong learners.</p>

<h4><strong>LEARNING AND EXPLORING WITH PARTNERS</strong></h4>
<p>Students have many opportunities to explore their interests, discover
their strengths, broaden their exposure, and learn about different career
pathways through hands-on sessions, learning journeys, workshops, talks
or roadshows conducted with PSEIs and industry partners. Besides picking
up knowledge and skills, students also get to interact with industry experts
and gain an idea of in-demand skills in the real-world. These learning
experiences complement school-based ECG activities to support students
in making informed education and career choices.</p>
