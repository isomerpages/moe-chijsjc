#### **OVERVIEW**

Education and Career Guidance (ECG) is about equipping students with the necessary knowledge, skills, and values to make informed decisions at each key education stage for successful transition from school to further education or work, so that they can manage their education and career pathways and practise lifelong learning throughout their lives.&nbsp;By nurturing self-awareness and self-directedness for lifelong learning, ECG helps students develop a growth mindset, adaptability and a resilient attitude to embrace future opportunities and appreciate all occupations across society.

ECG is developmental in nature and seeks to meet the developmental needs of students at every stage of education. The emphasis for Primary schools is on&nbsp;**Awareness**, for Secondary schools on&nbsp;**Exploration**, and for Upper Secondary and post-Secondary levels on&nbsp;**Planning**.

Learn about ECG and the resources available to support students in their journey from school to further education or work&nbsp;[here](https://www.moe.gov.sg/education-in-sg/our-programmes/education-and-career-guidance/overview).

#### **OUR OBJECTIVES**
In SJC, ECG aims to:  
      
1.  Nurture studentsâ€™ self-awareness and self-directedness for lifelong learning
2.  Enable students to explore education and career options, by equipping them with skills and resources to source for information   
3.  Create opportunities for students to build positive connections with the community (such as teachers, ECG counsellors, parents, industry partners), to develop an appreciation for different career pathways; and    
4.  Help students develop a growth mindset, a resilient attitude to embrace future opportunities, and appreciate all occupations across society.

In addition, all students take part in **Passion Ignite** as part of ECG. This is dedicated time for them to carry out their Student-Initiated Learning (SIL) on Home-Based Learning (HBL) days for them to pursue their own interests and learn outside the curriculum. Students can use the time to pick up knowledge or skills to delve deeper into their areas of interest, or explore areas they are curious about to broaden their exposure. Selected students will present and share their Passion Ignite journey at SIL Showcase. Through this, we hope to encourage students to become self-directed and lifelong learners.

#### **LEARNING AND EXPLORING WITH PARTNERS**

Students have many opportunities to explore their interests, discover their strengths, broaden their exposure, and learn about different career pathways through hands-on sessions, learning journeys, workshops, talks or roadshows conducted with PSEIs and industry partners. Besides picking up knowledge and skills, students also get to interact with industry experts and gain an idea of in-demand skills in the real-world. These learning experiences complement school-based ECG activities to support students in making informed education and career choices.
