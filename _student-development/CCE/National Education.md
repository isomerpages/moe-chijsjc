Our students are engaged in a curriculum that embodies the objectives of citizenship education and anchored on key citizenship dispositions. The citizenship curriculum aims to engage the ‘Head, Hearts and Hands’ of our students through various activities and events planned through the year.

In engaging the ‘Head’, lesson packages for the four key commemorative days as well as contemporary issues and current affairs are implemented in the classroom during CCE lessons. Students get to discuss debatable questions and engage in civic discourse. Through this process, we hope to heighten the students’ civic-literacy and build their confidence in voicing their opinions.

To engage the ‘Heart’, opportunities are created to help students develop as sense of appreciation and belonging to Singapore. For example, in 2019, we inaugurated the Sec 3 NRIC Citizenship Ceremony. Through the ceremony, we hope to inculcate the importance of citizenship as well as educating the students about the rights and privileges which citizens enjoy in a country. Through the lesson prior to the ceremony, the students learn that their citizenship comes with rights but they also have to exercise responsibility as citizens. This is our attempt to engage their ‘Heart’.

In engaging the ‘Hand’, students have been given opportunities to give back to society. In the midst of COVID-19, the school collaborated with the Masks Sewn With Love movement as part of the 2020 National Day celebration. Students and staff rallied together to help assemble and pack masks for the disadvantaged in society.
