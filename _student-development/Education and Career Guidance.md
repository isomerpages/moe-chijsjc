#### **Overview**


Education and Career Guidance (ECG) is about equipping students with the necessary knowledge,  skills, and values to make informed decisions at each key education stage for successful transition  
from school to further education or work, so that they can manage their education and career  pathways and practise lifelong learning throughout their lives.  By nurturing self-awareness and self-directedness for lifelong learning, ECG helps students develop a growth mindset, adaptability and a resilient attitude to embrace future opportunities and appreciate all occupations across society.

ECG is developmental in nature and seeks to meet the developmental needs of students at every  
stage of education. The emphasis for Primary schools is on **Awareness**, for Secondary  
schools on **Exploration**, and for upper Secondary and post- Secondary levels on **Planning**.
