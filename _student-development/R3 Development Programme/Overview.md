#### **R3 Development Programme**


The Student Development Team (SDT) oversees the design and delivery of a holistic student development experience. With a focus on character education and life-skills development, every SJCian is nurtured to be a _Woman of Integrity with the Passion to Pursue Excellence_.  

  

The SDT works closely with the Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) department, the Student Management team, and with Form Teachers to meet the social-emotional needs of our students. Together as a school, we work together to deliver a coherent and customised experience that grounds our students in a core set of values whilst equipping them with 21st century competencies that will prepare them for the future.

#### **Our Approach**


We adopt the **Positive Behaviour Intervention and Support (PBIS) Tiered Approach** in the design of our programmes. The structures and programmes implemented are catered to 3 tiers of students where:

#### **R3 Framework for Student Development**


Based on the PBIS approach, a comprehensive range of programmes built on the R3 Framework of Responsibility Building, Relationship Building and Resilience Building are planned and delivered to meet the varied needs of our 3 tiers of students that seek to develop the students holistically as well as provide the Student Development Experience (SDE) during their secondary school life.
