#### **Our Objectives**


To help our students build positive relationships with both peers and teachers and to equip students with relationship management skills.  

#### **Our Programmes**


1.  **Form Teacher (FT) Time:**
    
    FT Time, part of a 2-period session per week within the curriculum time is for Facilitation Games, Circle Time, Profiling, Specific teaching of skills (problem solving skills, positive reframing), Gratitude exercises (writing of thank you cards, appreciation notes), and Journaling. It provides the opportunities for building Teacher-Student relationship (TSR) and student-student relationship (SSR) within the class.

2.  **After-school Engagement** is available daily via structured and unstructured activities. All these activities are held in The Circle Room. Students are kept meaningfully engaged after school and have opportunities to forge stronger bonds with one another.

  

3.  **Post-Exam Activities** as its name suggests are organized during the post-exam period to further engage the students and provide opportunities for them to learn new skills.

4.  **Peer Support** is the support given to students within each class. Our Peer Support Leaders (PSLs) are equipped with a set of skills to enable them to support their peers within the class. They are also empowered to plan and conduct bonding activities for the class.

5.  **Peer Mentoring and Big Sister Mentoring**: In Peer Mentoring, lower secondary students are mentored by their seniors in subject areas such as Mathematics. We also tap on our Alumnae (Big Sisters) to mentor some of students especially those in Tier 2 and Tier 3. Being closer in age to the students, they tend to relate and connect better. It also provides the platform for our Alumnae to pay it forward.

  

6.  **Self-Initiated Projects for Student Engagement and Empowerment**. In SJC, we believe in Engagement and Empowerment. It is not enough to merely engage the students but to also inspire and motivate them to want to give back to the community.

7.  **The STAR Class Award: “Success through Positive Attitude and Resilience”**. An award that recognises collective class efforts in attendance, punctuality, participation in school events and class pride. It endeavours to motivate and encourage all members in the class to work together for a common goal, hence promoting stronger ties as a class and to build better class spirit.
