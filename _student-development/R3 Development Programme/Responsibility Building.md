#### **Our Objectives**


Student responsibility occurs when students take an active role in their learning by recognizing they are accountable for their success. We aim to guide students to the truth of and internalize the school values and code of behavior and support students to:  

  

*   Take responsibility for their learning and development and participate actively in their learning activities;
*   Take responsibility for their actions and make restitutions to address any harm that their actions may have caused;
*   Become an active member of the school and community and take actions that contribute to the building of a safe, caring and conducive learning environment.
