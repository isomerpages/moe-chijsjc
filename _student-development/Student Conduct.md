<h1>SJCian's Code of Conduct</h1>
<p>Every SJCian matters and the school aims to nurture a caring culture and
positive climate. Students learn well when there is order and discipline.
At the same time, they need care, encouragement and space to learn from
mistakes and improve. Discipline is an educative process, and the goal
is to instill self-discipline and good character in SJCians, equipping
them with the necessary social and emotional skills to behave thoughtfully
and be responsible and respectful individuals.</p>
<p>Every SJCian is expected to be an individual with exemplary character
and positive attitude towards school and the community. The following Code
of Conduct should guide SJCians’ behaviour and actions at all times.</p>
<h4><strong>1. MORNING ASSEMBLY</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>SJCians who are Singapore Citizens must sing the National Anthem and take
the Pledge. SJCians will take the Pledge with their right fist over their
heart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All SJCians should stand at attention and face the flags when the National
Anthem is being sung and the National Pledge recited. Please wear your
pinafore when singing the National Anthem and taking the Pledge to maintain
a respectful appearance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>2. ATTENDANCE &amp; PUNCTUALITY</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Daily attendance during term time is compulsory. The same is expected
for CCA and any activity organised by the school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SJCians should submit to their Form Teacher, upon return to school, a
valid Medical Certificate or Letter of Excuse (not more than 4 per term)
from parents or guardians. Absence from school without valid reason is
considered as truancy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SJCians should be punctual for school, CCA and other school activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SJCians should be physically present in school for morning assembly by
7:30 a.m. to be marked as present.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students who are repeatedly late will face appropriate consequences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SJCians are <u>not</u> allowed to leave the school premises before their
scheduled dismissal time without permission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SJCians who need to leave before the scheduled dismissal time should complete
the ‘Early Release Form’. Parents or a close relative must give consent
for students to be released early.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>3. GENERAL BEHAVIOUR</strong></h4>
<p><strong><em>In school:</em></strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>SJCians should show kindness and consideration to others at all times,
to promote a positive and safe environment for teaching and learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SJCians are also expected to be responsible for the safekeeping of their
personal belongings and considerate in the use of all school equipment
and facilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every SJCian is responsible for the locker assigned to her. The lockers
are school property and may be searched by school authorities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All food and drinks should only be consumed in the canteen. During timetabled
snack break, students may eat in the classroom after seeking permission
from the teacher. Students should maintain the cleanliness of classrooms
by disposing of all litter in covered bins after eating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SJCians are not allowed to have in their possession any weapons. They
are also not allowed to bring any weapon-like item which is used or intended
to be used to cause harm to others.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>In the classroom:</em></strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>SJCians should observe the <strong><em>GROW</em></strong> protocol, as every
lesson is an opportunity to grow in&nbsp;character and learning:
