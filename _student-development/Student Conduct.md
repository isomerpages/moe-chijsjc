Every SJCian matters and the school aims to nurture a caring culture and positive climate for all. 

Students learn well when there is order and discipline. At the same time, they need care, encouragement and space to learn from mistakes and improve. Discipline is an educative process, and the goal is to instill self-discipline and good character in SJCians, equipping them with the necessary social and emotional skills to behave thoughtfully and be responsible and respectful individuals.  

Every SJCian is expected to be an individual with exemplary character and positive attitude towards school and the community. The following Code of Conduct should guide SJCians’ behaviour and actions at all times.
