We take pride in the supportive and caring culture in SJC. School programmes are planned with the girls' well-being and social-emotional needs in mind. All staff, as well as a dedicated team of school counsellors and Student Welfare Officer are there to guide and offer support for students in need.

### **Student Support Team**

The Student Support Team comprises the School Counsellors, Special Education Needs Officer (SENO), Student Welfare Officer (SWO) and Education and the Career Guidance (ECG) Counsellor. They work together with teachers to provide support required for our students to strive and thrive.

The Circle Room is a dedicated space for students to self-regulate and participate in after-school activities. There are drawing materials, games and books for students use as they take a time out or bond with their peers.

·Build positive relationships to foster a sense of belonging,
