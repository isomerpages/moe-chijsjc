<h3><strong>The Art of Communication through Theatre and Debates</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Desired Outcomes</strong></h4>
<p>SJC’s ALP aims to shape students into effective communicators who speak
clearly, confidently, and convincingly. Through the 4-year programme, students
will also develop empathy and critical thinking, growing into discerning
and perceptive communicators.</p>
<h4><strong>Learning Experiences</strong></h4>
<p>The school-wide programme consists of learning experiences centred on
theatre, oracy. These enable students to broaden their knowledge and deepen
their appreciation of literary arts, specifically theatre production, as
well as to strengthen their proficiency in articulating and expressing
their thoughts through the spoken word.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These learning experiences are supported by the English Language, Literature
and Mother Tongue Languages curricula, which are anchored by key pedagogical
approaches such as inquiry-based learning and drama-based pedagogy. Students
are introduced to basic knowledge and skills of speech and drama, which
build on other skills such as writing, synthesis, literary analysis, and
storyboarding. Students are also given opportunities to hone these skills
through projects such as producing video blogs, delivering speeches, and
engaging in debates and discussions. These also contribute to the students’
development of invaluable skills such as perspective taking, creative meaning-making,
and collaborative learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond the classroom, students also have opportunities to attend plays
at the theatre, participate in speech and drama workshops, competitions,
festivals, and exhibitions. These empower students to learn through authentic,
active, and collaborative learning experiences. Consequently, these also
cultivate a deeper appreciation of the various languages and cultures in
students, shaping them into global citizens who communicate effectively
and empathetically.</p>
