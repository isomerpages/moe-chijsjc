<p>Students spend a significant amount of time in school with their peers
and teachers. Developing positive relationships with both peers and teachers
becomes critical for our students to feel safe and motivated to learn.</p>
<p>Therefore, a strong bond with peers and teachers is important to deliver
desirable outcomes, such the ability to work in teams, embrace diversity
and feel confident in the face of challenges.</p>

<h4><strong>Our Objectives</strong></h4>
<p>To help our students build positive relationships with both peers and
teachers and to equip them with effective relationship management skills.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Programmes</strong></h4>
<h5><strong>Form Teacher (FT) Time:</strong></h5>
<p>Time is set aside every week for Form Teachers and their students to deepen
their connection via class activities and Heart=to-Heart Talks. Students
also strengthen their relationship by taking various inter-class challenges
which are led by the class leaders such as the Class Monitors and Peer
Support Leaders (PSLs).</p>

<h5><strong>Peer Support</strong></h5>
<p>Class Leaders are equipped with skills such as peer influencing and promote
positive peer behaviour. They are also equipped with resources to promote
peer bonding during FT Time.</p>
<p>The PSLs, guided by the Student Leadership Committee, are also involved
in organising activities to increase awareness for issues pertaining the
wellbeing of students.</p>
