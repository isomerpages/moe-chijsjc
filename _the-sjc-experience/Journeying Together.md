Students spend a significant amount of time in school with their peers and teachers. Developing positive relationships with both peers and teachers is important for students to feel safe and motivated to learn.

In addition, bonding with peers and teachers creates positive experiences, which lead to desirable outcomes, including the ability to work in teams, embrace diversity and confidence in the face of challenges.

### **Our Objectives**

To help our students build positive relationships with both peers and teachers and to equip students with relationship management skills.

### **Our Programmes**

#### **Form Teacher (FT) Time:**

Time is set aside every week for Form Teachers and students to have peer bonding and 1-to-1 conversations to deepen their connections.  Students may also bond with each other through fulfilling the Bingo Challenge led by the Peer Support Leaders (PSLs)

**Peer Support**


Every class have Class Monitors and Peer Support Leaders (PSLs). The leaders are equipped with skills such as peer influencing and promote peer helping behaviour. They are also equipped with resources to promote peer bonding during FT Time.

The PSLs, guided by the Student Leadership Committee, are also involved in organising activities to increase awareness for issues pertaining the wellbeing of students. For example, in the 2023 Cyberwellness Month, the PSLs designed a board game to help their peers understand more about how to recognise and stop cyberbullying.
