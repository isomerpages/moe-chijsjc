<h2>Learning for Life Programme 2025</h2>
<h3><strong>Desired Outcomes</strong></h3>
<p>SJC’s LLP aims to empower students to bring L.I.G.H.T. into the community.
L.I.G.H.T. stands for the SJC school values of Love, Integrity, Gratitude,
Humility and Tenacity. Our LLP leverages Values In Action and Student Leadership
programmes to guide students to lead with confidence, serve with humility
and relate with empathy. Through the 4-year programme, students also develop
adaptive thinking and communication skills, growing into confident youth
leaders who spark positive change to the community around them.</p>
<h4><strong>VIA Learning Experiences</strong></h4>
<p>The 4-year programme includes broad themes for students to explore and
work on projects ranging from Sustainability (Sec 1), School (Sec 2), and
the Elderly (Upper Secondary). Our close partnership with external organisations,
including social enterprises and Senior Activity Centres in the Sengkang
and Punggol area allow students authentic and meaningful opportunities
to make a difference. To extend their influence, selected groups present
their projects and learning in the annual Passion Ignite and VIA showcase
to their peers during Learning Week.</p>

<h4><strong>Student Leadership Learning Experiences</strong></h4>
<p>Students are empowered to take up leadership opportunities at various
levels in schools and we believe all students can be and should be developed
as a leader of self to become women of influence. The 4 main groups of
student leaders are Student Council, Sports Leaders, Class Leaders, and
CCA leaders. They lead in various school events and engage their classmates
in various initiatives, such as enhancing peer support in class to sustainability
efforts.</p>
