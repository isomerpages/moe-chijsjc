### **Bringing L.I.G.H.T. To The Community**

In SJC, we develop every student to bring the L.I.G.H.T. into the communities that they are in through the VIA and Student Leadership programmes.

#### **OUR APPROACH**
SJC has adopted the Community Problem Solving (CmPS) strategy, a component of The Future Problem Solving Model developed by Paul Torrance as the approach for our LLP which is implemented through Values-in-Action (VIA) experiences for all students. We have also adopted the 5 Practices of Exemplary Leadership as an approach for student leadership. The 5 Practices of Exemplary Leadership are cascaded down to each level.


#### **OUR PROGRAMME**

In lower secondary, through class VIA projects, students are exposed through a combination of lectures, workshops, newspaper article readings to social issues such as sustainability, Singapore’s ageing population and the challenges that youths face. Students then identify issues that they would like to address. Guided by their form teachers, they brainstorm and subsequently work through mini-solutions using the Learn-Act-Reflect approach. This process of identification, analysis, selection and proposal of solutions introduces students to basic project management and collaborative work as the process takes close to half a year.

In upper secondary, students are provided with their second platform for community work as a class via their Secondary Three Camp Metamorphosis Level Camp when classes work with TOUCH community agencies. Some CCAs have also come on board over the years and set aside the time to work on community outreach as well. The graduating students also initiate and implement their own community projects.

Since the inception of the LLP in 2014, issues that students have chosen to work on include environmental sustainability, care and respect for animals, youth addiction to social media and social isolation. Organisations that SJCians have partnered regularly include NParks, PUB, NLB, St Luke’s Elder Care, as well as kindergartens and primary schools in the Sengkang and Punggol community.
