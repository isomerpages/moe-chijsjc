<h3><strong>Level Camps</strong></h3>
<p>One highlight of every school year is the level camp, where SJCians venture
outside the classroom to learn with their peers and take part in different
challenges to develop their confidence, resilience and self-awareness.</p>
<p>Here are some snapshots from the 2025 level camps:</p>

<p><em><sub>Our Sec 1 girls traded their classrooms for three days of adventure and fun in the great outdoors. From building sandcastles, hiking to outdoor cooking, these activities helped our girls step out of their comfort zone to develop their resilience and confidence.</sub></em>

<p>Our Sec 2 students honed their teamwork and creativity through a series
of hands-on challenges both on land and water over three days filled with
fun and laughter.</p>
