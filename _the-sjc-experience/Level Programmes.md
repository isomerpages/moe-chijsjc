Outside of lessons, all SJCians can look forward to a wide range of school activities as part of their holistic development. 

These programmes are planned to develop positive character traits, create shared memories and foster school spirit. Cohort-wide activities also cater to the girls' needs and interests according to the stage of their school journey:


| Level | Theme | Focus |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Secondary 1     | A Whole New World     | Understanding & Leading Self     |
| Secondary 2 | Time to Flourish | Growing Confidence & Working with others |
| Secondary 3 | Embracing Change | Knowing others, Impacting & Inspiring Others |
| Secondary 4/5 | Lighting the Way | Becoming my best self and inspiring others |


### **Level Camps**
One of the highlights of the school year is the level camp, where SJCians get to learn outside the classroom with their peers and take part in different challenges to build their confidence and self-awareness.

Here are some highlights from the 2022 level camps, and how our girls benefitted:
