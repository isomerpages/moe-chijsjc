<h4><strong>Objectives</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To nurture inspiring leaders who: lead with confidence, serve with humility
and relate with empathy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To equip our students with an understanding of key leadership principles,
and guide and train them to take on greater responsibilities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Our Approach</strong></h4>
<p>We believe that every student has the potential to lead others. We will
provide opportunities for students to experience leadership roles and equip
them to lead more effectively.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Our Student Leadership Experiences</strong></h4>
<p>Our leaders include the Class Monitors, Peer Support Leaders, CCA Leaders,
Sports Leaders and Student Councillors.</p>
<p>The school’s L.I.G.H.T values and the ‘Leadership Challenge Model’ (LCM)
by Kouzes and Pozner anchor our Student Leadership Development programme.&nbsp;
The 5 practices (Modelling the Way, Inspiring a Shared Vision, Challenging
the Process, Enabling Others to Act, and Encouraging the Heart) are progressively
introduced to students in their respective student leadership roles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Student leaders at SJC will go through a series of leadership-related
lessons, training and enrichment activities to equip them with basic theory
and soft skills for their respective roles. The leaders are also provided
with different opportunities to enact their leadership potential, in school-wide
programmes and events.</p>
