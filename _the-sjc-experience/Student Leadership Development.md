#### **Objectives**
*   To nurture the leadership potential in all our students.
*   To equip our students with an understanding of key leadership principles, and guide and train them to take on greater responsibilities.

#### **Our Approach**
We believe that each girl has the potential to lead others. We will provide opportunities for students to experience leadership roles and equip them to lead more effectively. 

#### **Our Student Leadership Framework**

Our framework comprises 3 tiers:

**Tier 1: Self and Small Group Leadership**

**Self-Leadership:** 

*   All students receive equipping during CCE lessons to prepare them for leadership roles in the future, as a supporting member of a team who participates in various school and community events.

**Small Group Leadership:**

*   'Everyone has a role to play' - students encouraged to take leadership roles as subject/functional representatives in class, or as junior leaders in CCAs.

**Tier 2: Class and Junior CCA Leadership**

*   Class Monitors and Peer Support Leaders comprise ‘Class Leaders’ who help manage the overall environment of the class, well-being of their peers, and help organize certain activities for the class.  Junior CCA leaders are lower secondary ExCo members of CCA.

**Tier 3: School & Senior CCA Leadership**

*   School Councillors and Sports Leaders organize cohort or school level activities.  Senior CCA Leaders help lead their CCA programmes and training.  

**Equipping for Leadership**

Student leaders will go through a series of leadership-related lessons, training and enrichment activities which provide basic theory and soft skills for their respective roles.

For instance, Class Monitors, Peer Support Leaders, CCA Leaders, Sports Leaders or School Councilors receive equipping in facilitating discussions, planning and event organizing, public communication, etc, as their roles require.

The ‘**Leadership Challenge Model**’ (LCM) by Kouzes and Pozner underpins our Student Leadership Development programme.  The 5 practices (Modelling the Way, Inspiring a Shared Vision, Challenging the Process, Enabling Others to Act, and Encouraging the Heart) are progressively introduced to students in their respective student leadership roles.
