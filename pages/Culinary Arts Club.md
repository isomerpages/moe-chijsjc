#### **About**


The Culinary Arts Club is a platform where students experience hands-on sessions on the art of food preparation, cooking, presentation and serving. However, we do not just prepare palatable food, pleasing to the eye. Our members also conduct research on themes, present their findings and reflect on processes too.  

  

We also organize learning journeys to a variety of places related to food resources such as local farms, markets and restaurants to broaden our culinary knowledge and further our culinary adventures. We learn much and are often challenged to step out of our comfort zone. We believe that these activities will allow our club members to grow and deepen the skills and passion of our budding chefs! The Culinary Arts Club encourages camaraderie and strives to work together efficiently, to live up to our motto:Â **BAKE. EAT. LOVE**

#### **Objectives**
