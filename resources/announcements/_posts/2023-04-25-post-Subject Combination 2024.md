Dear SJCians and Parents/ Guardians,

The Sec 3 Subject Combination 2024 provides students with opportunities to choose subject combinations based on academic merit and interest in subjects offered. A microsite has been set up as a one-stop information page for students and parents. The microsite includes the list of subject combinations offered in each stream, the eligibility criteria for different subject combinations, post-secondary education pathways and the timeline for the Subject Allocation Exercise. 

You may access the [link](https://sites.google.com/view/sec-2-subject-combination/home?authuser=0) to find out more.

Thank you.
