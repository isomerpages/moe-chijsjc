<p>Dear SJCians and Parents/ Guardians,</p>
<p>The Sec 3 Subject Combination 2025 provides students with opportunities
to choose subject combinations based on academic merit and interest in
subjects offered. A microsite has been set up as a one-stop information
page for students and parents. The microsite includes the list of subject
combinations offered in each stream, the eligibility criteria for different
subject combinations, post-secondary education pathways and the timeline
for the Subject Allocation Exercise.</p>
<p>You may access at this link <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/sec-3-2025-subject-allocation/home?authuser=0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">'Sec 3 Subject Combination 2025'</a> to

<p>Thank you.</p>
