This year marks our schoolâ€™s 85th anniversary and we would like all SJCians, past and present, to share in the celebrations!  
  
For a start, we launched the **85 Acts of Kindness campaign** last week as a call to everyone to live out the IJ mission and serve the larger community. Besides the class and CCA Values in Action projects, we invite everyone to share accounts of any kind acts that you have observed SJCians carry out or personal acts of kindness that you would like to contribute at https://go.gov.sg/sjc85kindacts. This way, others can also be inspired and pass on the good deed.  
  
Here is an overview of the exciting series of events we have lined up for the year. Do look out for more details on our celebrations here, and on our social media platforms!
